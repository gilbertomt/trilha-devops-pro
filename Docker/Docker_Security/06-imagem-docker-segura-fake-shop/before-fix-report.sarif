All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised."

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/sched: Abort __tc_modify_qdisc if parent class does not exist\n\nLion's patch [1] revealed an ancient bug in the qdisc API.\nWhenever a user creates/modifies a qdisc specifying as a parent another\nqdisc, the qdisc API will, during grafting, detect that the user is\nnot trying to attach to a class and reject. However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/d912cbd7-193b-4269-9857-525bee8bbb6a@gmail.com/"

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1] https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/d912cbd7-193b-4269-9857-525bee8bbb6a@gmail.com/",

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\neventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion\n\nEnsure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than\nEP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.\n\nCurrently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and\ndoes some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't\nlimit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:\n\n - They don't look upwards in the tree.\n - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of\n   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit\n   28d82dc1c4ed (\"epoll: limit paths\").\n\nEssentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just\nserves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.\n\nA more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph\nedge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no\npaths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5\nedges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.\n\nAs a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,\ntested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may\nhave changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 (\"eventpoll: Fix priority inversion\nproblem\").)\n\nTo fix it:\n\n1.

So we should never zero-copy and\nthen find out that the record type has changed. The corner case\nwe missed is when the initial record comes from rx_list, and it's\nzero length."

Since it does not use the\nunused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:\n\nbtrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused\n                                           if list_empty // false\n        list_del_init\n        clear_bit\n                                           else if (test_bit) // true\n                                                list_move_tail\n\nAnd we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs\nstate for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to\nprevent.\n\nThe broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:\n\n  [1272.943527] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n  [1272.943967] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 61 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.944731] Modules linked in: btrfs virtio_net xor zstd_compress raid6_pq null_blk [last unloaded: btrfs]\n  [1272.945550] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 61 Comm: kworker/u32:1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.14.0-rc5+ #108\n  [1272.946368] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n  [1272.946585] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014\n  [1272.947273] Workqueue: btrfs_discard btrfs_discard_workfn [btrfs]\n  [1272.947788] RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.949532] RSP: 0018:ffffbf1200247df0 EFLAGS: 00010282\n  [1272.949901] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa14b00e3f800 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  [1272.950437] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffbf1200247c78 RDI: 00000000ffffdfff\n  [1272.950986] RBP: ffffa14b00dc2860 R08: 00000000ffffdfff R09: ffffffff90526268\n  [1272.951512] R10: ffffffff904762c0 R11: 0000000063666572 R12: ffffa14b00dc28c0\n  [1272.952024] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffa14b00dc2868 R15: 000001285dcd12c0\n  [1272.952850] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa14d33c40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [1272.953458] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [1272.953931] CR2: 00007f838cbda000 CR3: 000000010104e000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  [1272.954474] Call Trace:\n  [1272.954655]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n  [1272.954812]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955173]  ? __warn.cold+0x93/0xd7\n  [1272.955487]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955816]  ? report_bug+0xe7/0x120\n  [1272.956103]  ? handle_bug+0x53/0x90\n  [1272.956424]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x13/0x60\n  [1272.956700]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [1272.957011]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.957399]  btrfs_discard_cancel_work.cold+0x26/0x2b [btrfs]\n  [1272.957853]  btrfs_put_block_group.cold+0x5d/0x8e [btrfs]\n  [1272.958289]  btrfs_discard_workfn+0x194/0x380 [btrfs]\n  [1272.958729]  process_one_work+0x130/0x290\n  [1272.959026]  worker_thread+0x2ea/0x420\n  [1272.959335]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.959644]  kthread+0xd7/0x1c0\n  [1272.959872]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960172]  ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n  [1272.960474]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960745]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n  [1272.961035]  \u003c/TASK\u003e\n  [1272.961238] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nThough we have seen them in the async discard workfn as well.

                "text": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV\n\nRLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU\nregisters in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and\nregister reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex. This function is invoked\nfrom amdgpu_sriov_wreg, which in turn is called from\ngmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb.\n\nThe [ BUG: Invalid wait context ] indicates that a thread is trying to\nacquire a mutex while it is in a context that does not allow it to sleep\n(like holding a spinlock).\n\nFixes the below:\n\n[  253.013423] =============================\n[  253.013434] [ BUG: Invalid wait context ]\n[  253.013446] 6.12.0-amdstaging-drm-next-lol-050225 #14 Tainted: G     U     OE\n[  253.013464] -----------------------------\n[  253.013475] kworker/0:1/10 is trying to lock:\n[  253.013487] ffff9f30542e3cf8 (\u0026adev-\u003evirt.rlcg_reg_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.013815] other info that might help us debug this:\n[  253.013827] context-{4:4}\n[  253.013835] 3 locks held by kworker/0:1/10:\n[  253.013847]  #0: ffff9f3040050f58 ((wq_completion)events){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: process_one_work+0x3f5/0x680\n[  253.013877]  #1: ffffb789c008be40 ((work_completion)(\u0026wfc.work)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: process_one_work+0x1d6/0x680\n[  253.013905]  #2: ffff9f3054281838 (\u0026adev-\u003egmc.invalidate_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb+0x198/0x4f0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014154] stack backtrace:\n[  253.014164] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10 Comm: kworker/0:1 Tainted: G     U     OE      6.12.0-amdstaging-drm-next-lol-050225 #14\n[  253.014189] Tainted: [U]=USER, [O]=OOT_MODULE, [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n[  253.014203] Hardware name: Microsoft Corporation Virtual Machine/Virtual Machine, BIOS Hyper-V UEFI Release v4.1 11/18/2024\n[  253.014224] Workqueue: events work_for_cpu_fn\n[  253.014241] Call Trace:\n[  253.014250]  \u003cTASK\u003e\n[  253.014260]  dump_stack_lvl+0x9b/0xf0\n[  253.014275]  dump_stack+0x10/0x20\n[  253.014287]  __lock_acquire+0xa47/0x2810\n[  253.014303]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.014321]  lock_acquire+0xd1/0x300\n[  253.014333]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014562]  ? __lock_acquire+0xa6b/0x2810\n[  253.014578]  __mutex_lock+0x85/0xe20\n[  253.014591]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.014782]  ? sched_clock_noinstr+0x9/0x10\n[  253.014795]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.014808]  ? local_clock_noinstr+0xe/0xc0\n[  253.014822]  ? amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015012]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.015029]  mutex_lock_nested+0x1b/0x30\n[  253.015044]  ? mutex_lock_nested+0x1b/0x30\n[  253.015057]  amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw+0xf6/0x330 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015249]  amdgpu_sriov_wreg+0xc5/0xd0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015435]  gmc_v11_0_flush_gpu_tlb+0x44b/0x4f0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015667]  gfx_v11_0_hw_init+0x499/0x29c0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.015901]  ? __pfx_smu_v13_0_update_pcie_parameters+0x10/0x10 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016159]  ? srso_alias_return_thunk+0x5/0xfbef5\n[  253.016173]  ? smu_hw_init+0x18d/0x300 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016403]  amdgpu_device_init+0x29ad/0x36a0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.016614]  amdgpu_driver_load_kms+0x1a/0xc0 [amdgpu]\n[  253.0170\n---truncated---"

If one of the\nlocks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current\nrunqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window\nit is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some\nother CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is\nmigrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to\nwake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue\n(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the\ncurrent checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no\nlonger in the pushable tasks list.\n\nCrashes\n=======\nThis bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel\npanics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page\nfaults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all\ncoming from scheduler itself.\n\nSome of the crashes:\n-\u003e kernel BUG at kernel/sched/rt.c:1616!

In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or\n`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the\n`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.\n\nFor `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the\nsupplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at\nleast exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in\n\"comedi_fops.c\" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are\nallocated.  However, if `insn-\u003en` is 0 (which is allowable for\n`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain\nuninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a\ndifferent instruction in the array of instructions handled by\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being\nwritten to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output\nchannel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the\ninternal saved state of the channel.\n\nFix it by returning 0 early if `insn-\u003en` is 0, before reaching the code\nthat accesses `data[0]`.

Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the\nruntime context:\n\n  ctx = container_of(current-\u003ebpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);\n  storage = ctx-\u003eprog_item-\u003ecgroup_storage[stype];\n\n  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)\n    ptr = \u0026READ_ONCE(storage-\u003ebuf)-\u003edata[0];\n  else\n    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage-\u003epercpu_buf);\n\nFor the second program which was called from the originally attached\none, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former\nprogram's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result\nin an unintended out-of-bounds access.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of\nstorage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original\nprogram if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or\nii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not\nusing any of the cgroup local storage maps."

Similarly, it is used as a default\nhandler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler\nfor `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`.
